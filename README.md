# codenamize-js

**Generate consistent easier-to-remember codenames from strings and numbers.**

Port of [Codenamize](https://github.com/jjmontesl/codenamize) into JavaScript.

# Overview

**Codenamize** is a JavaScript library that
returns consistent names for objects, by joining
adjectives and words together. These are easier to remember and
write down than pure numbers, and can be used instead or along UUIDs,
GUIDs, hashes (MD5, SHAâ€¦), network addresses and other difficult
to remember strings.

This can be used to replace identifiers or codes when presenting those to users.
As words are easier to identify and remember for humans, this module maps
JavaScript objects to easy to remember words.
